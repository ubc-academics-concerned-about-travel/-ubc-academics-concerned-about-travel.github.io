	<p>Dear President Bacon, Deans of the Faculties at UBC, and Board of Governors,</p>
    <p>In support of UBC's goal of <b>a 50% reduction in UBC's aviation emissions by 2030</b>, we are updating our <a href=https://zeroemissionuniversity.com/open-letter-ubc/ >Open Letter</a>
 of September 2019, urging you to take concrete steps to reduce pressures on UBC faculty members to fly.</p>
	<p>"The science is clear. ...we need to shift into emergency gear," says the UN Environmental Programme.</p>
	<p>Well-suited to be leaders in that shift, <b>academics are perhaps the most open-minded, knowledgeable, ethical professionals whose work is to change minds</b> ...of students, policymakers, the public and ourselves. If not we, who will lead in replacing in-person with virtual travel as the climate crisis grows? 
	<p>Let's aim to regain the top position in the Times Higher Education’s ranking of universities for climate action. UBC ranked #1 in 2019 and 2020, #3 in 2021, #7 in 2022 and #4 in 2023. We are still the only university to be ranked in the top 10 in all 5 years.</p>
	<p>While we are proud of UBC’s recognition, we know there is so much more to be done and gained. UBC has an opportunity to lead on reforms, modelling best practices and encouraging other universities and workplaces to dramatically lower emissions.</p>	
	<p>The 2023 IPCC report said “rapid and deep and, in most cases, immediate greenhouse gas emissions reductions in all sectors this decade” are required to keep the Earth within 1.5C of warming in this century.</p>
	<p>UBC’s Climate Emergency Task Force Report of January 2021, stated:<p>
	<p>"Scope 3 emissions (including emissions from air travel, food, commuting, and embodied emissions associated with buildings) should be reduced by 45-50% by 2030. (p. 20)</p>
	<p>"We heard recurring requests for shifting UBC policies to disincentivize air travel frequency." (p. 86)</p>
	<p>We agree. And we applaud the UBC Board of Governors for endorsing the target of a 50% reduction in our aviation emissions by 2030.  We now urge you to accelerate actions to achieve this.</p>
	<p>One study found that air travel emissions amount to 40% of UBC’s total greenhouse gas emissions. In fact, this percentage is a low estimate, as it includes only travel billed through the university. Our faculty regularly fly all over the world to give lectures, present their work in colloquia, participate on external reviews and committees, often funded by external sources.  </p>
	<p>A number of UBC policies and practices work to promote more aviation travel.  We fully recognize that this is a systemic problem in academia and beyond. But we feel that the climate emergency requires us to act now and show other universities how to do it. </p>
	<p>Our interest is in changing the culture at UBC to support fewer work-related travel emissions. Such a change requires measurement, incentives and institutional support. Toward this end, we have seven requests:</p>
    <ol>
		<li><p><b>Videoconferencing Tools and Budgets.</b> The COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated the feasibility of rapid transition to online meetings including hybrid conferences, yielding surpluses in travel budgets. We ask that UBC remove financial accounting obstacles to using savings from travel budgets to invest in high-class videoconferencing and virtual travel technologies.  The bottom line is: with better facilities and better platforms, faculty will take this option more seriously and further savings will be achieved.</p></li>
		<li><p><b>Tracking Tools and Incentives.</b>  Easy tracking of carbon emissions is crucial to helping people reduce their emissions. We recommend that faculty members be incentivized to take 1-2 minutes each year to submit anonymously  a count of their flight destinations in the previous year.  The best time to do this is when we complete our annual Activity Reports. We have designed and tested an online form for that purpose.  Departments should be incentivized to report a high baseline level of emissions so they can get more credit and rewards for reductions in the coming years.</p></li>
		<li><p><b>Merit and Promotion.</b>  Many faculty feel compelled to travel so as to boost their CV and chances for merit and promotion, particularly to give keynote lectures or participate in colloquia. We request that in-person international presentations be removed from consideration for merit and promotion, as this only serves to encourage faculty to rack up international invitations. Toward this end, faculty who are trying to reduce emissions could be encouraged to list their declined invitations on their CVs, and faculty could be encouraged to present remotely at such conferences (as some of us have). Regional invitations/talks or video-presentations could be given equal or more weight. Faculty could be asked to evaluate the impact of their travel before accepting or declining invitations. For many, having an “excuse” to decline certain invitations (“My university is encouraging aviation reduction”) would actually be welcome. But for this to work, departments, DAC and SAC must all rethink the weight that they give to such presentations.  UBC’s policy for promotions does not require travel but, in practice, departments’ assessments of individual faculty members’ reputations are influenced by numbers of invited presentations in distant locations.  Presentations by video should count equally, if not more.</p></li>
		<li><p><b>Virtual Workshops and Speakers Series.</b>  Departments regularly fly in speakers from around the world to give talks to their faculty, often for only a day. Many of us organize workshops with national or international participants. UBC should offer incentives to departments that report the flight information of participants, pledge to reduce the emissions of their invitees, and initiate more named lectureships that can be delivered by video. While decisions would be made at the departmental level, support at a higher level would help make that attractive. One way to do this would be to make UBC a regional hub for workshops (perhaps in partnership with other green-aspiring local universities involved in PICS), and to earmark funding for workshops or speakers that are low emissions.</p></li>
		<li><p><b>Virtual External Reviews.</b>  We request that you give serious thought to how we can adapt some of our policies and requirements that traditionally require long-distance travel.  External reviews of departments require people to come to campus in person for meetings that could be done virtually.</p></li>
		<li><p><b>Virtual Interviews.</b>  In 2019, a UBC medical student led a study of the aviation emissions of Canadian medical students for their interviews by residency programs across Canada. The study revealed waste, high costs and inequity. After the pandemic forced doing such interviews by video, the study findings led residency programs to continue interviewing by video. UBC can build on this experience by embracing a policy requiring out-of-province applicants to medical school to be interviewed by video. Based on the Faculty of Medicine’s experience, this policy could be extended to interviews for admission to other UBC Faculties.</p></li>
		<li><p><b>Research Grant Processes.</b>   Major funding agencies used to require faculty to be present in person to evaluate grant proposals. During the pandemic, this was done by video meetings and found to be cheaper and more equitable.  So the practice was continued after the pandemic eased, by some but not all grant agencies.  In 2022, the Tri-Councils approved a policy of allowing travel funds to be spent on offsets but they do not require researchers to budget for and monitor flight emissions.  UBC should work with the national funding agencies to consider low-carbon criteria in research applications, to pursue the lowest carbon strategies for adjudication, and to require investigators to submit emission budgets with their financial budgets, and emission reports with their final reports.</p></li>
	</ol>

	<p>Forest fires, droughts, heat domes and floods in BC and worldwide, confirm what the IPCC has been telling us for years: the window for avoiding global catastrophe is rapidly narrowing. <p>
	<p>Let us lead by example and show the universities of the world that, if we can do better, they can too.</h5> <p>
